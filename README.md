Externalising the new MS spectra backend-supporting infrastructure
from `MSnbase`. Could either survive as its own package or be
phagocyted back into by `MSnbase`.

# Basic ideas and concepts

- `Spectra` should become the main object to represent MS data.

- No explicit `Spectrum` objects, *spectrum* data (m/z - intensity
  pairs) will be represented as a `matrix` stored/provided by the
  `Backend` class.
